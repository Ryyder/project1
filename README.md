# Chromatic Control - project1

A simple app you can use to control your wifi light bulbs. The bulbs will change color based on the temperature and weather conditions outside. The user will be prompted for google/gmail authentication (firebase), then asked to enter in their bulb id. After this, the user can enter in a city, address, or zipcode into the searchbox. Google maps will pin their search request and then the bulb will change color based on temperature and weather conditions.
